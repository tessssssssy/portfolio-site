Target audience
---
This site is intended for prospective employers. This could include both technical people such as CTO's and senior developers  and non technical users such as HR managers etc. Therefore it is important to include features that are relevant to each audience. While screenshots of code and links to git repositories will be mostly relevant to other developers, it is also important to include visuals of projects and their features, as well as links to deployed sites where they exist, to engage a wider audience.
